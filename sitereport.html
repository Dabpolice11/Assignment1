            Whilst I already knew the basics of html and CSS as I learnt it in A level it was incredibly interesting and
            fun to learn new skills such as classes and grid templates. I particularly liked classes as it means that I
            could target and change specific parts of the website without altering other parts. However, I struggled a
            bit on the mobile optimization. Whilst I got the different CSS files working, I struggled to figure out how
            to open and close the navigation bar at the side of the mobile version. I also at first struggled to figure
            out how to set a different grid layout for the project page however once I thought about adding a class onto
            it, it was quite easy. I found the colour palette online on coolors. I decided to make the header bar the
            darkest colour to make it stand out more than the other ones as it is the header. I then decided to make the
            footer the lightest colour to make that stand out as well from the main and sidebar. The Nav bar, main and
            sidebar were then put as colours in between the header and foot colour but put them as separate colours so
            that they stand out from each other. I also then put it on so that when you hover over the nav button it
            will change the background colour to a darker blue to indicate that you would click that button. I also
            decided to make the font colour white as so that it stands out from the blue background. I also found 2
            fonts on google fonts. The first font I found was for the headers and the sidebar header. This makes the
            font look more futuristic and techier. I then got a different font for the navigation, this makes the words
            stand out more compared to normal writing however not more than the headings. The debugging process showed
            some issues with the code that I never would have thought about if I didn’t debug them such as the h1 tag
            being on both header and sidebar. It didn’t like this so meant that I changed the sidebar into a h2 tag with
            the same CSS code. Overall, the whole experience of building the website was fun as it allowed me to develop
            new skills that will most definitely be useful in the future.
