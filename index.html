            more about me. A Formula 1 enthusiast fueled by exilleration of pushing the boundies of stuff such as a car
            , just like my favorite driver, Lando Norris. When I’m not following the thrill of formula 1 (when its off
            season) , you can find me playing on my guitar, enjoying into the raw energy of rock music.
            This site is a reflection of my journey as a student so far, blending my interests and showcasing the
            projects I’ve created over time. Whether it’s exploring my creations on the Projects Page, sharing my
